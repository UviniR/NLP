# Natural Language Processing (NLP) ✍️ 
This is a collection of notebooks covering diverse areas of NLP.

 * Most of these notebooks are associated with my [Kaggle Codes](https://www.kaggle.com/code/uvinir)
 * I have attached the link to the respective Kaggle notebook at the begining of each code
 * Most of the datasets used are availabe on Kaggle
 * All the unavailable datasets are uploaded to Kaggle account (public access)/ uploaded to this repo

I am still researching on NLP!!! 
So the repository will be updated frequently with my new learnings
